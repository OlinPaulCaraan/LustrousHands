                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever pass by a place that you used to be at all times back in the days, the streets you used to walk by, 
                            roads that you used to cross with someone and just like the school you graduated from. It kind of bring back a lot of memories 
                            that you shared with important people that became part of your life. Do you still remember the last time you saw each other? 
                            Were you still talking to each other? Is the closeness still there? 
                            <br><br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is just a lot of precious moments that I kept in my heart that I reminisce. 
                            I had old classmates that I used to be really good friends, close friends and even best friends but I wonder why we never talk anymore 
                            when we used to be chat mates in classroom or even in social media. Literally, distance can really make people be distant to each other. 
                            It’s just sad that we were not able to maintain the relationship as close as before 
                            but I know that we still have a good place to each other’s heart even just a small space. 
                            Sometimes when I remember people, I will look for old group chats, open personal messages and read past conversations. 
                            It’s funny to read how innocent I was before and how silly I can be in old conversations.  
                            I just wander if they also do the same, or if we still share the same memories in the past or they have forgotten it already. 
                            It’s nostalgic but then again when you grew apart with people, things can change. They meet new friends and you also meet new one. 
                            Someone might relate to this, and also remembering moments they shared to people and but don’t hesitate to reach out, 
                            a simple “Kamusta ka?” might just open another chapter for the unclosed book of your friendship.
