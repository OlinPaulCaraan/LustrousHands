                                        What is love? Love is an amazing feeling in where people is happy and contented. 
                                        Love also comes with pain to make the person understand the definition of it. 
                                        It’s ok to fall in love but don't forget that you have limitations and being in pain 
                                        with the one person you care is one of the best example. Our waiting has a purpose. 
                                        They say that life is short to make love with others but good things take time to happen.

                                        Thinking of waiting for true love seems boring and unhappy but when you get the feeling of it 
                                        makes you excited to know the sincere and honest feeling that you can get in the future. 
                                        Rushing things like love can make you loathe yourself if you are waken up from reality 
                                        that s/he may not be the one for you. People should love their selves first	
                                        to be able to love someone truly. Yes there is nothing wrong to fall in love easily, 
                                        we can learn from the mistakes of yesterday but never let it happen when tomorrow comes. 
                                        Waiting for someone is hard to do but when you wait for true love 
                                        it is the best gift that you will ever receive.

                                        Being single for now doesn't makes you look like no one loves you, we all have friends and family to support us. 
                                        Without someone we can enjoy ourselves by making our own rules. It’s easy to love when you are all set and ready 
                                        because when you have nothing, would you still prefer it when it is not convenient and you are tired and hurt? 
                                        If anyone have a restless soul and tired heart, one day we all get the love more than we imagine. 
                                        Whatever happens wait for our own true love to make a happy ever after.
