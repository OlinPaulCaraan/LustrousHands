                              To The Best Mom,
                              <br><br>
                              There are so many things I want to say, but somehow words always fall short. Still, I’ll try, because you deserve to hear it.
                              Thank you. For everything. For the sacrifices you made without a second thought. For the nights you stayed up, the mornings you rose early, the days you put everyone else before yourself. For being my shelter in every storm, and the loudest cheerleader when I needed courage.
                              You’ve been my safe place, my steady voice, and my strongest example of love in action. You taught me more through your kindness, strength, and patience than any words ever could. When the world felt like too much, your arms were home. When I didn’t believe in myself, your belief carried me through.
                              I know it hasn’t always been easy. There were moments I took you for granted, misunderstood your intentions, or failed to say how much I appreciate you. If I could go back, I’d say “thank you” and “I love you” a hundred times more. But I’ll start now.
                              You are more than a mother. You are a miracle in motion. A quiet warrior. A giver of unconditional love.

                           <p>
                              So here is to you, the best mom anyone could ask for. I hope you feel as loved and valued as you truly are. I hope the world gives back a piece of the goodness you pour into it every single day.
                              <br><br>
                              With all my love,
                              Your son
