                              <br><br>
                              Hi, How are you? Do you still remember me? How about the times we had, does it cross over your mind? 
                              <br><br>
                              Frankly, I still can't forget the moment we had in high school. 
                              When we finished performing the speech choir I had to run to the bathroom to wash my feet and use my hanky to wipe off the dirt and suddenly use it to cover your eyes.
                              I know it's gross but we used to be friends and I'm shameless when I do those things especially that I am comfortable around you.
                              You're tall and I'm the opposite, I had to tiptoe to reach your eyes and cover it from the back.
                              Do you know what's the best thing is? 
                              that's when you turn around and I lost my balance but you catch me before I fall, your strong arms keeping me away from the ground, holding me close to you, our eyes meet,
                              the world seems in slow motion and the unexpected spark that I felt inside.
                              After that, I always wanted to go early in class excited to see you, because being with you makes me happy.
                              <br><br>
                              Do you also remember after school we walk with our friend, and you stop beside me just to put your red headset on me to listen to one direction song,
                              unfortunately, I don't remember what song it is but I felt my heartbeat increase, my hand shakes and I startled, those mixed feelings were all because of you.
                           </p>

                     </td>
                     <td rowspan="2" valign="top" align="left">
                        <font face = "consolas" size = "5">
                           <p>
                              After all these 7 years I still feel the love I have for you.
                              I still have this notebook full of words I wanna say and feelings that I kept inside, even the sketch of you and me.
                              I was afraid to tell you this at first but I got the chance. 
                              Sadly, you said that we can't be more than friends, you have reason and I have mine. 
                              I have no reason to make boundaries just to love you but your point is we both are in a different religion. 
                              I'm disappointed because I know that love conquers all, nothing can stop a person to love the other.
                              Those words that came out of your mouth felt like a gushing cold wind down to my heart.
                              I had this feeling that someday I could reach the star that I've been following through night and day.
                              I wanted to fight for the love that I have but you pushed me away.
                              I hesitantly try to forget you and this feeling cause I don't wanna lose you but then I realized that I have to love myself first so that I can find a man who could love me The way I am.
                              <br><br>
                              I hope you find a better one that loves you more than I could.
                              Thank you for the memories, I will cherish it with all my heart.
                              Again, thank you and goodbye.
